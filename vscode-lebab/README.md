https://lebab.io/try-it

## Usage

Launch command palette and search for `ES5 to ES6`.

This will create a temp file (untitled) in the same directory, which can be saved for reference.


## Bug

There is a bug vscode, when creating dynamic files with 'untitled' schema. Where it will say:

`Path must be a string. Received undefined`.
